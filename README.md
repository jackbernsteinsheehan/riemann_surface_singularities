We're modeling heat diffusion, starting in 1d and working to 2d and then eventually to curvature on Riemann surfaces. To run the simulation, you'll need to install numpy and matplotlib.
Then you can edit the initial conditions and boundary conditions to create a different environment for the simulation. Our model solves the heat equation to model diffusion across a surface.

This project will eventually be used to study conic singularities on Riemann surfaces, but for now it's a simple simulation of heat diffusion.
